This folder contains visualizations for vertex normal prediction on mesh objects, as well as acceleration direction prediction on deformable objects. 

1. We add two additional baselines, Bartal Tree and FRT Tree to the mesh vertex normal prediction experiment.

2. We add an aditional experiments for acceleration direction prediction on deformable object (flag). As we can see, the predicted acceleration direction from our FTFI can accurately predict the ground truth direction.
